# DEVELOPMENT IDEAS

Here are some ideas for the future development of the game.

**Note:** These are **JUST IDEAS** and are no indication of any actual confirmed changes, although I do hope some of these do make it into the game.

## Proposed Ideas...

### Game Name Change: Meteor Striker X

The name *Space Ship Game* is quite generic and bland. It would be good if it got a better name.

I'm currently thinking of making the name *Meteor Striker X*!

Feel free to let me know your suggestions.

### Boss Asteroid: Planet Cracker

Not thought about this much yet, so more on this later.

### Special Asteroids

The current asteroids are good as a base, but I want to extend these further.

#### Item Asteroids

These asteroids will appear more goldish in colour, and when destroyed will drop a Power Up.

#### Electro Asteroids

When hit by an Electro Asteroid, your shields will be reduced by 3, or all remaining shields if less than 3.

#### Big Asteroid

Your shields will be reduced by 2, or if no shields will be equivilant to 3 hits on the space ship hull.

### Space Ship Health

Currently when you get hit, your shields will be reduced by one with each hit until none, and if you get hit again with no shields, your space ship is destroyed.

I want to change this behaviour so that your space ship has hull integrety. Meaning it will take damage but not get destroyed instantly from a standard asteroid attack. This also provides potential scope for more powerful asteroids to cause more damage.

The ingegrety of the space ship's hull will probably be indicated by a health bar or numerical value displayed near the ship.

### Power Ups

I've talked about wanting to add more powerful asteroids to the game, but obviously there needs to be a counter measure to this to protect you.

Power Ups will give you extra protection and abilities to help you defend the world from these nasty asteroids. Let's take a look at some of the ideas I have for these.

#### Brief Invulnerability

This power up will allow the space ship to be hit without losing any shields. It activates as soon as you collect it and lasts for 5 seconds.

#### MultiShot

Fires 3 laser beams at once with the addition of diagonal left and right laser beams alongside the normal forward laser beam.

#### HyperLaser

Fires a non-stop single laser beam forward, allowing you to destroy any asteroid in line of sight with the beam as you move. Lasts for 5 seconds.

#### Tactical Nuke

Will destroy all asteroids on screen [or within current wave].

You collect this power up and use it when ready. It can only be used once.

#### Shield Booster

Instantly boosts your shields by 2, allowing for extra shield protection against being hit by the asteroids.

### Waves of Asteroids

Currently, all asteroid generation is completely random, and sometimes that looks like waves when there is a gap in between.

I may change it so that the asteroids come in waves and give you some breathing space in between to travel some more, or take your hands of your controls for a moment.

## Conclusion

I want to stress that these are not confirmed plans for the game, simply ideas to give me something to potentially work on and implement into the game, although I do hope some of these will get added.

Feel free to let me know your thoughts and even contribute to these ideas. Watch this space for more.
