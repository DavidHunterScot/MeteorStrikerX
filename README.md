## Objective

The world we love so much is about to be destroyed by asteroids from a nearby solar system. No one knows the story behind the asteroids, other than they are heading straight for us.

You must travel through space and destroy all the asteroids before they collide with our world.

For extra protection, you have shields that will protect you from some of the asteroids, but if you get hit too many times, your shields will no longer protect you, and it will be game over.

You have this one chance to save us all the best you can. Good luck!

## How to Play

- LEFT ARROW KEY = Space Ship Move Left
- RIGHT ARROW KEY = Space Ship Move Right
- SPACE BAR KEY = Fire Laser Beam
